The radio and music players are very good sound quality. The smart phone type features are easier and faster to use than any smart phone I have used. There are some software glitches that are documented on the Nokia support site which proved easily fixed. Even though many of the Nokia based features are no longer supported by Microsoft, you can still use the features needed by accessing the web directly via WIFI connection - or data if you want to pay for the privilege - and launching the site/application from there. Although the new Nokia browser is pretty Spartan in appearance, it is fast and runs with good stability. I am a very big guy with lands large even for my size and I find the full qwerty keyboard to be pretty easy to use. I like the programmable hot keys and on-screen shortcuts. Keeps you from launching items that require data connections by accident. The back lighting is thorough and even and the raised buttons are tactile with a positive click response. The phone does have a few quirks. There is no airplane mode as far as I can tell. The flight profile doesn't seem to be able to be set with the broadcasting and receiving functions turned off. The main navigation button/mouse is a little small and doesn't always respond as expected - that might be me though. All in all I would recommend this phone and vendor highly if you want the features of a smart phone but you don't need GPS or a big data bill every month for a bunch of things you don't need or want to keep you life running smoothly.\",\n",

       " \"First off, let me say I've been a Nokia user since I had my first cell phone at age 16, ten years ago. Of course there was that one year where I ventured off into Samsung land but that phone died and back to Nokia I went. But I've always enjoyed Nokia phones.Second, I've been looking for a QWERTY phone with internet/video/mp3 playing capabilities and the Asha 302 fits it. It is a strong build, as I have dropped it numerous times and the phone is still intact. I like the keyboard as I am not a fan of touchscreens at all (which is why I didn't get the Asha 303). As far as sound I think it depends on your headphones. I had earbuds that produced a loudness of 93 decibels which made the listening experience mediocre but then I bought buds with a 110 db loudness and the sound is much better. Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy. I won't get into video games and SNS because I don't even do that on my PC so I don't have a reason to use it on my phone.My only wish is that the 302 had a built in antenna so I could listen to re radio without RDS earbuds. Other than that, it's a really great phone and for those who want to move up into Blackberrys but don't want to pay so much the Nokia Asha 302 is a great phone to start with.EDIT (October 3, 2013): I found a\\xa0Gino 25cm 4 Section Telescoping Stainless Steel AM FM Radio Antenna 3.5mm Plug\\xa0to use for playing the radio through the speaker. So now I'm really enjoying the phone for when I'm sitting outside with friends or at my desk.\",\n",

       " \"This is a solidly-built unlocked phone that is an update to the popular Nokia C3. It runs the S40 software which has its goods and bads. It has good reception and nice audio. The 3g supports 850 and 1900 bands (AT&T and T-mobile when it's hspa is refarmed from 1700/2100 to the 1900 pcs band.) + the 2100 band.The keyboard is pretty good, not as firm as other Nokia qwerty phones (e.g. E5), but comparable to the C3 keyboard. The one that I have is obviously for the world market, since it has some added European chars and symbols on the keypad. Wi-fi works fine, and Opera Mini installed and runs without problems - good way to go for a bit of web-surfing. I did not tried any of the e-mail or social clients. Text messaging can be set to 'normal' in-box or conversation modes. OVI store app does not seem to work that well. There are a couple of features that I found appealing: ability to backup the phone memory to the sd card; ability to lock the keypad with a passcode either manually or automatically after a set time. The battery is fairly good sized (BL-5J). The 'function' keys and the d-pad keys can all be re-assigned to user defined short-cuts. My opinion: it is a worthy update (3g) to the C3, not quite in the same league as the more expensive E5 which has the multi-tasking S60 software. For the price of around $110, it is an unlocked feature (gsm/3g) phone well worth considering, as long as one knows that one is getting a non-smart phone and that apps for S40 is very limited.\",\n",

       " \"Preface: This is not what would be considered a smartphone in the United States (Nothing on the par of Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone), it is basically a feature phone. Also, although it says here that it has a US warranty all of the warranty material it came with referenced Latin American countries so I am not sure if it is really covered under a US Warranty. I returned it during Amazon's return window so it wasn't an issue. Now for the phone review.Pros: The phone has a great keyboard. If you are familiar with the E-series phones its that type of keyboard. The interface is some sort of modified Symbian and I liked it in a lot of ways. The style of the hardware is attractive and the Gray is a nice color. The camera was pretty decent considering it is only 2 megapixels. For e-mail it's adequate.Cons: I'll start with the small issues and work up to the big problem that ultimately made me decide to return the phone. The onboard social network apps are not fully functional. You can update your Facebook or Twitter status but the rest of it is so-so. The Ovi store in general is a poor app store, but this phone isn't able to use many of them. Even the old Facebook app that I used on my old E71 (It used to be called Snaptu but Facebook has since renamed it to Facebook for Everyone) is incompatible with this phone as are most of the better apps in the Ovi store. The browser was mediocre, barely passable. Also, NO GPS for this phone. Nokia/Ovi Maps is incompatible which is too bad because that has always been a Nokia strength. That immediately eliminates this phone as a smart phone. With all of that said, I bought this phone for my wife and she really only needed a phone for texts and calls so we could have overlooked these things. The problem we could not overlook was the very shabby, flimsy piece of metal that was supposed to hold in place the standard sim card. This little piece of metal was barely attached to the phone and would not lock into place to hold down the sim card. Because the sim card would intermittently get lose inside the phone and constantly lose the signal. So we would have to take the battery out and re-adjust the sim card. Then it would work for a little while only to ultimately have to repeat the process. It was WAY more frustration than it was worth. It's too bad because as a basic phone for calls, texts, e-mail, and occasionally updating your Facebook/Twitter status; this phone has a lot of potential. Becuase of the problem with the sim card holder, however, it was essentially unusable. I have used Nokia phones for years (I use a Lumia 710 personally) and I am really surprised Nokia would do such a sloppy job on something as important as the part that holds the sim card in place. What a waste.\",\n",
       " 'We just received the phone a few days ago. Put in the Consumer Cellular SIM card, and it is ready to go. The phone seems very nice even though we have not come close to discovering all of the things it will do. It has a large number of ring tones built in.',\n",
       " \"I bought this phone as a Christmas present for myself because I wanted something a bit more advanced than the Nokia C2 I purchased from Amazon in 2012, but didn't want to go all the way with a smartphone. In other words, a good feature phone with smartphone features without the touch screen. Red, however, is my favorite color, but I went for the white one because my C2 is silver and I couldn't find a silver Asha 302 on Amazon. I've had it for a week and it works great. Best is the Wi-Fi feature, which gives you access to the Web without purchasing a data plan (which I may have to do if I want to access personal email or go on Facebook). It has the great calendar, alarm clock, text messaging, camera, missed/received call and other features of the C2, which makes it a keeper. And it's a little bigger, with a wider screen, but not so big it can't fit into my pocket or purse. I can use the same Nokia charger I had for the C2. Now all I have to do is await the arrival of my purple phone skin, then I'll be all right. I've had Nokia phones since 1999 and they've never let me down - just get better!\",\n",

The texting interface is very nice and intuitive. The battery life is stellar. It connects to the internet just fine. I can check my email in case of emergency, look up directions, etc. Basically everything I was able to do with my smartphone, without the bells and whistles. Having a physical keyboard is quite nice too. The OS seems very stable and snappy. You have things like calendar, todo, memos, etc.Backup is a snap. Just insert an SD card and go to Settings to back it up. No more iTunes! If you want to add music or podcasts, just plug it into the computer, copy paste to the SD card and you're done.I would buy this phone again definitely if I broke or lost it.\",\n",
       " \"This phone, like all of Nokia's feature phones, are great for their value and durability. The last phone I had before buying this one was a Nokia C-3, which was also a great phone. It lasted for years, and probably would have kept going if I hadn't accidentally jumped into a pool with it in my pocket :P This phone is basically an update of the C-3. It is sleek and small, has a full QWERTY keyboard, and has Wi-Fi internet browsing. This is the best phone you can get if you're looking for functionality, but don't want to throw hundreds of dollars at a smartphone with a data plan.And the buyer should be aware; this is NOT a smartphone. If you're looking for anything like a smartphone, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a toy you can take out of your pocket every couple of minutes to tinker around with, you will be disappointed. Yes, it does have an internet browser which works well, but the screen is quite small so it's not good for recreational browsing. I just use it to look things up, it works fine for that. It also has some social network apps, but I don't use them. I don't know how well they work, but if that's a priority for you this phone probably isn't the best choice. Same goes for the camera; I don't use it, can't speak to its quality, but if a camera is important to you this isn't the best choice.The only other potential negative I can see in this phone is that the keys really are pretty small. I haven't had an issue with them personally, but if someone has big hands I see how this could be annoying.I bought this phone for the advantages to NOT owning a smartphone: longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still good at accomplishing what it needs to. If you're looking for the same thing, Nokia is definitely the best way to go.\",\n",

The screen is sharper, processor faster, phone takes nice clear pictures that are pretty much good enough, the ring and alert tones are more discreet and professional. The internet and mail stuff is actually useable on T-Mobile's 3.5G network and requires very little data to stay connected on a minumal plan. Strangely, I cannot it do wifi yet ... it receives the signal but just insists on using network data or nothing at all. Probably a setting in the menu I have not toggled to the right setting. Anyway - if you want a phone that texts very easily, has a 4-day battery, a very convenient and useable features, and yet not crack open the crack-pipe of the internet constanly, the Asha 302 does it with style and then some. I may get myself another one or two for the future, as I bet this is the end-run for this type of practical phone.\",\n",

       " 'Keeping in mind that this is a sub $100 phone that has generally been advertised as the \"cheapest quad-core phone,\" the Landvo L800 has turned out to be a good phone that has exceeded my expectations. From all my research, Landvo seems to be a new company and the L800 was their first model which they released in March of 2014. I took a risk (although less than $100 isn\\'t a huge risk) in buying this in April with no reviews available. The main thing I was looking for was the most powerful, inexpensive phone at the $100 price point. Battery life was also a major factor. So I purchased this phone on the basis of being the only phone in the price range at the time with a quadcore processor and also because it sports a 2300mah battery which was about the largest battery at the price point of the available models.There were a lot of things I immediately liked about the phone. Despite the low resolution and lack of IPS, the screen is pretty crisp and the viewing angles are more than decent. The battery life has also been good--as I have been averaging two days of average use on a full charge. One day of heavy use would usually put me around the 30% range which still isn\\'t bad. I also was almost shocked by the build quality. The phone is heavier than most name-brand competition in its size class but it has a weighty, solid feel too it. The sides are metal, as are the volume rocker and power button. There are no creaks and everything fits together tightly. Fit and finish is top notch. I believe the screen is plastic and not glass, however. Their are pros and cons to this as a plastic screen is susceptible to scratching. However, it does mean that I will never have to worry about a cracked screen if I drop the phone. The phone came with a screen protector prefitted on the phone and an additional one in the box. The included silicone case is relatively simple but was also a nice touch, especially owing to the fact that a no-name brand phone is unlikely to have third party support for cases and such.However, I would not have recommended this phone to anyone at the time. Why? Because performance was lackluster. The quadcore SoC is quite snappy however, the small 512mb of ram was suffering on Android 4.2.2. I was wary of purchasing a phone with less than 1gb of ram and I was regretting it at this point. It would freeze and stutter during even the simplest tasks such as hammering out a text. I put forth my best efforts to streamline my system as much as possible to keep it running smoothly but the fact was it just didn\\'t have enough ram to power Android comfortably. I was ready to ditch the phone for something new.I have completely changed my tune, however, and wouldn\\'t hesitate to recommend this phone in a heartbeat. Why? Surprisingly, Landvo has supported with releasing an official 4.4 KitKat rom for the phone. For those who are tech savvy, this is a boon. KitKat was actually streamlined by Google so that devices with only 512mb of ram can run it comfortably (4.2 was a bit of a resource hog). At this point, I figured I had nothing to lose--I was planning on dumping the phone anyways. Needless to say, flashing to KitKat made a world of difference. The performance is literally night and day as upgrading to 4.4 literally got rid of *all* the lag I was experiencing with the phone. It is now quite fast--I would argue faster than my Sero 7 Pro tablet which is running the old but venerable Tegra 3 processor. Demanding, apps load quickly without stuttering. Animations are smooth and everything has become a joy to use with this phone.If you are looking for a ridiculously cheap, but fast 5.0\" Android phone with good battery life and good build quality, this is the one you are looking for hands down. It\\'s not going to compete with TOTL phones out there but for a measly $95, you shouldn\\'t be expecting that. What you get is a perfectly usable phone at an almost throw away price. I\\'ve noticed vendors selling the L800 with Android 4.4 already installed so it looks like the new stock of this phone has been upgraded. If you are not tech savvy and comfortable with flashing your phone, make sure you purchase one with 4.4 already installed! You will love it if you do.',\n",

If I need access to all those smartphone apps, I just use my laptop! Besides, the screens are tiny and I am farsighted, so that means if I use a smartphone, I am going to have to carry even more items: reading glasses.But I am an adventurous type, biking, motorcycling, hang gliding, scuba, etc. and could find myself in need of assistance during one of these risky adventures. And I do live alone and might need to get help in a car breakdown or a home injury situation. So I bought one of those pre-paid cells and thought, there you go that\\'s problem is solved. No it wasn\\'t. I kept pocket dialing. I couldn\\'t see the screen either. But worse thing was the battery would go dead on me every few days. Since I never used the cell phone except for emergencies, I would always always forget to charge it. So a prepaid didn\\'t work as my emergency phone.Jethro solved the problem. It is a big screen clamshell that is about as inexpensive as a pre-paid, but soooo much more useful. Because it is a clamshell, I get no more pocket dialing. Because it is a big screen, I don\\'t have to carry reading glasses around. I am actually using it a little for taking TODO notes and using the calculator, as well as its great FM radio and flashlight. And its battery lasts more than a week in standby mode! Honestly, I haven\\'t used it yet for a real emergency phone call yet (but I placed several test calls - works great) , but Jethro took my pre-paid T-Mobile SIM with no problems and I was up and running in a few minutes.So if you need a cellphone you can throw in your backpack or glove box in case of emergency, this is it.

I did have several problems at first, but this was my first cell phone so I didn't have much experience. I mistakenly set the language to Portuguese so I couldn't figure out what to do. Luckily there were several online tutorials at the web site and I restored the phone to the factory setting. Once in English I was able to figure the phone out more easily. One thing I figured out was to use military time as in 2pm equal 1400 when setting the time as there was no am or pm setting. All in all I am happy with the phone. Being hearing impaired I am able to hear the basic ring which is loud. When I put it in my pocket I face the keypad to my leg as the speaker comes out the back and it's even louder. Same thing when I set it on the table I put it face down and the ring is loud and clear. I questioned about using a lanyard and e-mailed the Jethro company. They got right back to me and confirmed that a small hole on the upper left side could accommodate a lanyard by removing the back, feeding the lanyard through the hole and looping it around before replacing the back. The customer service was nice and answered my question in an easy to understand manner. The phone will lock in my pocket so it wont random dial. All I need to do is press the * asterisks until the screen says the phone is unlocked, then I can dial out. The phone always accepts a call without turning it on. This is exactly the simple phone I was looking for. I returned several that did not work. I went with this model so I can use it with Consumer Cellular which is less expensive.

I hated that other phone as it was very confusing for me to operate the menu functions. So I took a chance on this one despite some of the complaints I read about in the reviews.Some of those problems have been addressed and corrected. It is no longer difficult to lock or unlock the keys. You press the lower left button down for a couple of seconds and the word locked comes up, I assume, since that\\'s what it says in Spanish. I set my mom\\'s phone to Spanish. There is a second way of doing it with a directional key, but we didn\\'t need to try it since my mom got it right away. And she is definitely not good with technology.Another complaint was about the clock being set to military, or 24 hr time. Well, you can now choose to set it to 12 hr.The phone was easy to set, which was a relief for me, compared to her previous phone. Let\\'s face it, it\\'s the non seniors who will probably have to set it up. Sometimes in an effort to simplify phones, they take away buttons which makes them harder to navigate.The phone is very light weight. The ringer is loud enough. I like the cradle, which is easier for a senior. You can\\'t beat the price. It worked well with the SIM card.On the negative side, I will agree with one complaint, it\\'s not loud enough. I turned the volume all the way up and was afraid mom would not be able to hear the caller. She agreed to give it a chance, but we may have to exchange it since her hearing is not great.

The sound if fairly good, functionality is glitchy. It's made in China and prefers to be set up with a google account. Lots of time the scrolling will snag and the screen is unresponsive to the touch. I haven't been ablebto stop the hepatic feedback on the keys when texting\\\\ typing. It can feather and be used as a WiFi hotspot which is good. It's pretty slow loading pages and downloading, I haven't taken any pics yet. It fleshy seem to want to play videos very well but that may be my phone company's hangup. If you're looking at the screen , you need to look straight on, at any angle, you can't see the screen detail. Gettingbthe back off is a struggle too but it's doable. It's plastic, not metal. The white one is white on the back, the face is black.\"]"

       " 'Keeping in mind that this is a sub $100 phone that has generally been advertised as the \"cheapest quad-core phone,\" the Landvo L800 has turned out to be a good phone that has exceeded my expectations From all my research, Landvo seems to be a new company and the L800 was their first model which they released in March of 2014 I took a risk (although less than $100 isn\\'t a huge risk) in buying this in April with no reviews available The main thing I was looking for was the most powerful, inexpensive phone at the $100 price point Battery life was also a major factor So I purchased this phone on the basis of being the only phone in the price range at the time with a quadcore processor and also because it sports a 2300mah battery which was about the largest battery at the price point of the available modelsThere were a lot of things I immediately liked about the phone Despite the low resolution and lack of IPS, the screen is pretty crisp and the viewing angles are more than decent The battery life has also been good--as I have been averaging two days of average use on a full charge One day of heavy use would usually put me around the 30% range which still isn\\'t bad I also was almost shocked by the build quality The phone is heavier than most name-brand competition in its size class but it has a weighty, solid feel too it The sides are metal, as are the volume rocker and power button There are no creaks and everything fits together tightly Fit and finish is top notch I believe the screen is plastic and not glass, however Their are pros and cons to this as a plastic screen is susceptible to scratching However, it does mean that I will never have to worry about a cracked screen if I drop the phone The phone came with a screen protector prefitted on the phone and an additional one in the box The included silicone case is relatively simple but was also a nice touch, especially owing to the fact that a no-name brand phone is unlikely to have third party support for cases and suchHowever, I would not have recommended this phone to anyone at the time Why? Because performance was lackluster The quadcore SoC is quite snappy however, the small 512mb of ram was suffering on Android 422 I was wary of purchasing a phone with less than 1gb of ram and I was regretting it at this point It would freeze and stutter during even the simplest tasks such as hammering out a text I put forth my best efforts to streamline my system as much as possible to keep it running smoothly but the fact was it just didn\\'t have enough ram to power Android comfortably I was ready to ditch the phone for something newI have completely changed my tune, however, and wouldn\\'t hesitate to recommend this phone in a heartbeat Why? Surprisingly, Landvo has supported with releasing an official 44 KitKat rom for the phone For those who are tech savvy, this is a boon KitKat was actually streamlined by Google so that devices with only 512mb of ram can run it comfortably (42 was a bit of a resource hog) At this point, I figured I had nothing to lose--I was planning on dumping the phone anyways Needless to say, flashing to KitKat made a world of difference The performance is literally night and day as upgrading to 44 literally got rid of *all* the lag I was experiencing with the phone It is now quite fast--I would argue faster than my Sero 7 Pro tablet which is running the old but venerable Tegra 3 processor Demanding, apps load quickly without stuttering Animations are smooth and everything has become a joy to use with this phoneIf you are looking for a ridiculously cheap, but fast 50\" Android phone with good battery life and good build quality, this is the one you are looking for hands down It\\'s not going to compete with TOTL phones out there but for a measly $95, you shouldn\\'t be expecting that What you get is a perfectly usable phone at an almost throw away price I\\'ve noticed vendors selling the L800 with Android 44 already installed so it looks like the new stock of this phone has been upgraded If you are not tech savvy and comfortable with flashing your phone, make sure you purchase one with 44 already installed!
